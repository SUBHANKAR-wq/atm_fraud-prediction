# atm_fraud-prediction
n this project,we will deal with the fraud detection in ATM.Australian banking client's profitability and reputation are being hit by fraudulent ATM transactions. They want PredCatch to help them in reducing and if possible completely eliminating such fraudulent transactions. PredCatch believes it can do the same by building a predictive model to catch such fraudulent transactions in real time and decline them. The Job is to build this fraud detection and prevention predictive model. The challenging part of the problem is that the data contains very few fraud instances in comparison to the overall population. To give more edge to the solution they have also collected data regarding location [geo_scores] of the transactions, their own proprietary index [Lambda_wts], on network turn around times [Qset_tats] and vulnerability qualification score [instance_scores]. As of now you don't need to understand what they mean.The data has been provided with different names because of the confidenciaity.
